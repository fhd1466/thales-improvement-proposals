## Simple Summary

Halving of AMM incentives and bribes across all exsiting incentivized LPs.

## Abstract

This TIP proposes additional tapering of AMM incentives and bribes across all exsiting incetivized LPs.

Current reward structure is:
- Optimism Arrakis THALES/WETH pool incentives: 20,000 THALES + 2,000 OP per week
- Optimism Velodrome THALES/WETH pool bribes: 6,000 THALES per week 
- Optimism Velodrome THALES/USDC pool bribes: 6,000 THALES per week 
- Base Aerodrome THALES/WETH pool bribes: 7,000 THALES per week 
- Base Aerodrome THALES/USDC pool bribes: 3,000
- Arbitrum Camelot THALES/WETH pool incentives: 5,000 THALES per week 

New reward structure to be:  

- Optimism Arrakis THALES/WETH pool incentives: 10,000 THALES + 2,000 OP per week (50% THALES reduction)
- Optimism Velodrome THALES/WETH pool bribes: 3,000 THALES per week  (50% reduction)
- Optimism Velodrome THALES/USDC pool bribes: 3,000 THALES per week (50% reduction)
- Base Aerodrome THALES/WETH pool bribes: 3,500 THALES per week (50% reduction)
- Base Aerodrome THALES/USDC pool bribes: 1,500 (50% reduction)
- Arbitrum Camelot THALES/WETH pool incentives: 5,000 THALES per week (no change, since arbitrum has the least TVL)
These emissions are to run for **8 weeks** until further revaluation.  
  
## Motivation
 
Thales emissions for LP's are far too high. This TIP aims to even out liquidity between chains while simultaneously equalizing them.
## Specification 

This TIP entials the Thales Protocol DAO and Treasury DAO to facilitate the following emissions:  
  
- Optimism Arrakis THALES/WETH pool incentives: `10,000 THALES + 2,000 OP` per week
- Optimism Velodrome THALES/WETH pool bribes: `3,000 THALES` per week
- Optimism Velodrome THALES/USDC pool bribes: `3,000 THALES` per week
- Base Aerodrome THALES/WETH pool bribes: `3,500 THALES` per week
- Base Aerodrome THALES/USDbC pool bribes: `1,500 THALES` per week  
- Arbtirum Camelot THALES/WETH pool incentives: `5,000 THALES` per week

The incentives in this proposal are to be valid for a period of `8 weeks` from implementation.
